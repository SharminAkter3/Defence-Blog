    <h3>1. What's the difference between var, let and const keywords in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>
        The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:<br>
        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.<br>
        Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their
        enclosing scope even before they are declared.<br>
        Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the
        immediate
        enclosing block.
    </p>

    <h3> 2. What's the difference between regular functions and arrow functions ?</h3>

    <p>
        Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise
        syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a
        similar manner, there are certain differences between them.
        <br>

        Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of the
        closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the arguments
        passed to arrow functions.

        <br>
        Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The value of this inside an arrow function
        remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the
        closest non-arrow parent function.s

    </p>

    <h3>3. What's the difference between foreach(), filter(), map() and find() ?</h3>

    <p>
        Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback function on each element of array one by one.Basically
        forEach works as a traditional for loop looping over the array and providing you array elements to do operations
        on them.
        <br>
        The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the
        callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true element remains in
        the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.
        <br>
        Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but whats makes it
        unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.
        <br>
        Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function
        returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first
        that has matched.
    </p>

    <h3>4. How we can use template string in JavaScript ?</h3>
    <p>
        Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate
        variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript.
        <br> It
        allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with
        template strings are tags. <br>Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as
        parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.
